                                            In this project, my team and I were tasked with finding an answer to the
                                            hypothesis
                                            based on the following report:
                                            <br><br>
                                            "According to a popular website on living and working in Singapore, quality
                                            of life is a measure of one's overall well-being that includes economic,
                                            social, physical, political, and spiritual factors. Singapore is considered
                                            to have a high quality of life and has been ranked as the top city in Asia
                                            in terms of quality of living. The country is also regarded as the happiest
                                            country in Southeast Asia according to the 2022 World Happiness Report.
                                            Factors considered in determining the quality of life in each country
                                            include the political and social environment, economic environment,
                                            socio-cultural environment, health and sanitation, schools and education,
                                            public services and transportation, recreation, natural environment,
                                            consumer goods, and housing."

                                            Based on the report, it seems that

                                                Singapore is a good place to live /

                                            With the use of Power Bi, we created a visual report that provides a

                                            overview of the quality of life in Singapore by looking into these 4

                                                After the data was cleaned and transformed, we created
                                                prototypes using
                                                Power Bi to test our ideas and to get feedback from our users to ensure
                                                that it supports the hypothesis.
                                                The following shows the final iteration of the prototype:

                                                The prototype was tested with our target users and the feedback was
                                                incorporated into the final visual report. The prototype when throught a

                                                In order to integrate each of our team member's prototype, a master
                                                navigation system has to be created to allow users to navigate between
                                                each of the visual reports easily.
                                            </p>

                                                The image above shows the master navigation in a form of a map that
                                                allows users to click on individuals factors and view the respective
                                                report. The user interface is designed by me to be simple and
                                                intuitive to allow easy navigation throughout the visual report.

                                            The visual report was well received by our users and the feedback was very
                                            positive. The visual report was also well received by our lecturers and was
                                            awarded the best visual report in the class.
